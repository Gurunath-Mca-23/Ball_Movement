# Random_Ball_Movement

# Project Description:

This HTML document features a red ball that moves diagonally across the screen. The ball's position is controlled by JavaScript, and it bounces between the top-left and bottom-right corners of the viewport. The animation speed and direction are adjusted through variables, creating a continuous back-and-forth motion. Additionally, an external stylesheet named "styles.css" is linked, but its content is not shown here.

# HowTo Run the Project:
Step 1: Save the HTML file with a html extension
Step 2: Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code, then click the "Go Live" button at the bottom right comer of the VSCode window to open a new browser window displaying the ball-moving animation.

# Future Improvements:
consider adding user interaction features like mouse or keyboard control to change the ball's direction or speed, or adding obstacles or targets for the ball to interact with creating a more engaging and interactive animation
